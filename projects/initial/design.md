# Requirements
In the initial phase the database should be operational database.
The intention for this database is rational (at least at the start).
It should be fast.


## Ideas
Support for WASI/WASM for extendability.
Rest-api for admins (Need to think about it, might introduce more complexity which is not needed)
Support for NoSql, KV, clustering, sharding, etc'
QUIC for faster database.
